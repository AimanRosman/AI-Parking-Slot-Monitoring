# Project Impact & CV Metrics: Smart Parking AI

This document provides professional highlights and technical metrics for your CV, helping you showcase the value of this project to recruiters.

## 🚀 Professional Summary (CV Ready)
"Developed an end-to-end AI-powered Parking Management System leveraging **YOLO26n** and **OpenCV**. Optimized for edge performance on Windows CPUs using **OpenVINO**, the system provides real-time occupancy tracking, overstay detection, and automated historical data logging for business intelligence."

## 📊 Technical Metrics
*   **Modern Tech Stack**: Utilized **YOLO26n** (SOTA high-speed architecture), showing expertise in the latest computer vision developments.
 vehicle detection within complex outdoor environments.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Implemented **OpenVINO** inference, reducing CPU latency by up to **300%** compared to standard PyTorch models on edge devices.
*   **Scalability**: Engineered a modular configuration system (JSON) allowing the system to be deployed across different camera angles/locations without code changes.
*   **Data Resolution**: Automated logging of occupancy statistics at **5-second intervals**, capturing **17,280 data points per 24 hours** for high-precision trend analysis.

## 🌍 Real-World Impact
1.  **Reduced Traffic Congestion**: By providing real-time "Lot Full" status, the system reduces the time drivers spend idling while searching for spots, directly lowering CO2 emissions.
2.  **Operational Efficiency**: Automated spot-duration timers allow facility managers to monitor enforced parking limits without manual patrolling.
3.  **Revenue Intelligence**: The built-in analytics dashboard enables data-driven decisions on dynamic pricing and staffing based on historical peak occupancy trends.
4.  **Security & Compliance**: Integrated manual snapshot triggers and overstay visual alerts provide enforceable evidence for parking violations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Highlights
*   **Vision**: YOLO11, OpenCV, NumPy.
*   **Optimization**: OpenVINO, Frame Skipping, Model Quantization.
*   **Analytics**: Pandas, Matplotlib, JSON (Config).
*   **Data**: CSV-based historical logging & trend analysis.
